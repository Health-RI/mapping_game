# mapping_game
Educational simple game to train metadata mapping, in the context of Health-RI.
This version of the game was used in the Health-RI FAIR Data Stewards Basics Course 2024.

# Game play 
-divide people into groups (competition element may be who finishes first and who has the best mapping)
- each group receives a print of the Health-RI metadata schema and a print of an example metadata set for a dataset.
-explain the game objective
	-match the metadata elements from the dataset to the model/schema
-distribute cards to the groups
-explain that there are different types of cards
-explain what types are there

-rules
	-no computers allowed
	 
-Game steps
	-analyse the metadata cards  (attributes)
	-analyse the dataset elements (fields)
	-analyse the value cards
	-analyse joker/"missing" cards
	-create a mapping of your dataset's metadata elements according to HRI metadata schema
	-use "missing" cards where necessary (to be modelled and to be collected)

Problems
	-there are more elements in the dataset than in the model
	-there are more elements in the model than in the dataset

Solution
	-correct dataset, metadata schema and values matching
	-correct use of joker cards

# Message of the game
	- sometimes you don't have all the elements of the model (they become elements for you to collect)
	- sometimes not all you have is modelled (they become model requirements)
	- some elements can be confusing and not straightforward - refer to documentation.
	- mapping can be straight forward but can also be ambiguous regarding interpretation (can use dcat identifier for both patient and sample). Seek community/data stewards help!

# Game ends when
The first group uses all cards (some joker cards may be left)

It may or may not include a prize
